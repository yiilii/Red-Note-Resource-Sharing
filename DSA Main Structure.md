# DSA Chapter III: Due Diligence Obligations for Digital Services

## Overview
The **EU Digital Services Act (DSA)** Chapter III (Articles 11-48) establishes a tiered framework of due diligence obligations for digital service providers, categorized by their roles and impact. The obligations escalate from general intermediary services to specialized categories like hosting services, online platforms, online marketplaces, and very large online platforms/search engines (VLOPs/VLOSEs). Additional provisions encourage voluntary standards and codes of conduct to enhance compliance. This document integrates the regulatory structure and obligations for each category, presented in a hierarchical and tabular format for clarity.

---

## Regulatory Structure
The DSA categorizes service providers based on their functions, with obligations building cumulatively across layers:

1. **Intermediary Services** (Article 2(g)): Services providing conduit, caching, or hosting (e.g., ISPs, cloud services, platforms).
   - Subcategories:
     - **Hosting Services** (Article 2(f)): Store and disseminate user information to the public (e.g., cloud storage, social media).
       - **Online Platforms** (Article 2(h)): Hosting services disseminating user-uploaded content to the public (e.g., social media, content-sharing platforms).
         - **Online Marketplaces** (Article 2(i)): Online platforms enabling consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders (e.g., Amazon, eBay).
         - **VLOPs/VLOSEs** (Article 33): Online platforms or search engines with ≥45M monthly active EU users (e.g., Google, Facebook).
1. **Other Provisions**: Voluntary standards and codes of conduct (Articles 44-48) apply across categories to support compliance.
